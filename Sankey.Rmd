## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df <- read.csv("Sankey.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
pl <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Manual.categories,                        
                     next_x =  Location,                                     
                     node = Animals,
                     next_node = , 
                     fill = factor(Animals)))
                     
pl <- pl +geom_sankey(flow.alpha = 0.5,          #This Creates the transparency of your node 
                      node.color = "black",     # This is your node color        
                      show.legend = TRUE)        # This determines if you want your legend to show

pl
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
